This script helps you stay active on GitHub by making automatic daily commits.

## How It Works

- Updates a `daily_log.txt` file with the current date/time
- Automatically commits and pushes the change

## How to Use

1. Clone your GitHub repo or create a new one.
2. Add this script inside the repo.
3. Run it manually or schedule it to run daily.

```bash
python3 daily_commit.py
